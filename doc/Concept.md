| Introduction                   | Minikube quickly sets up a local Kubernetes cluster on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It`s a tool that enables you to run a Kubernetes cluster locally on your machine, andsets up a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine (usually using VirtualBox or another hypervisor) on your local system | Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”. kind was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI | k3d is a lightweight wrapper that makes running Kubernetes (specifically, the lightweight k3s distribution) in Docker straightforward and efficient. It's designed to provide developers with a quick and easy way to test Kubernetes without the overhead of setting up a full cluster.     |

# Licensing risks in Docker
Another important aspect to consider is the licensing, Docker's engine is open-source, but some of the features it offers are under a commercial license. On the other hand, Podman is fully open-source and doesn't require any commercial permits.
